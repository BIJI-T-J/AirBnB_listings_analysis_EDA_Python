Airbnb, abbreviation of its original name, "Air Bed and Breakfast" is an American company operating an online marketplace for short-and-long-term homestays and experiences in various countries and regions. It acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. Airbnb was founded in 2008 
Here we analyze the AirBnB data history from ten cities to understand the impact of 2015 regulations on AirBnB and the factors that affect the prices especially in Paris.

## 2. Data exploring and cleaning
In this step we analysed the distribution of data in each column and according to that, we imputed the null values in each column. And finally checked that there is no null values or duplicate rows. 
## 3. Exploratory data analysis and insights building
In this step we analysed the data through charts and graphs and found insights and answered following questions
  -what insights do you have about the impact of the 2015 regulations on AirBnB ?
